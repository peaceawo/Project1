# Project1

## SUMMARY
### Description:
This application helps the user find a drink recipe based on the weather at their location. The user types in a zip code of any location in the US and gets by drink options. If the user wants a location outside the US, the user has to include the country code. For ex: 50813 UK. 

### Motivation: 
If our user has a special event as weddings, holidays, dinner parties, this app will reduce the stress of deciding on drinks and provide ingredient for the user to make the special occasion a time to remember. In a nut shell, this app satisfies indecisive adults over 21 needs to get a drink. 

### Results: 
Using the cocktail database, the open weather APIs, and Materialize we were able to create an app that generate drinks based on the weather.

 ### Improvement: 
Given more time, we will improve our app by adding filter options for the user. We will also include bar locations near you where those drink options will be available. Lastly, we will include a date picker where the user filters drinks based on the season ex: the holidays
